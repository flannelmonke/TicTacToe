## Tic Tac Toe
This JavaFX game is a simple tic tac toe project.
Created by me and my teammate Mark.
It can detect horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.
Once someone has won the board lights up red and must be cleared.
Scores are updated at the top of the screen.

Could use some minor implentations but still runs well.
