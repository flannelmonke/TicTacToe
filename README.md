## Tic Tac Toe
This JavaFX game is a simple tic tac toe project.
Created by me and my teammate Mark.
It can detect horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.
Once someone has won the board lights up red and must be cleared.
Scores are updated at the top of the screen.
----------------------------------------------------------
Could use some minor implentations but still runs well.

## NOTE
please edit the launch.json file to meet your system's requirements of your JavaFX lib files
you can find this on line 17 of said launch.json file and can simply edit the part that says
"PATH/TO/JAVAFX/lib"
